# Annenberg Hotkeys 4.0 Instructions 

 

## Introduction 

Annenberg Hotkeys version 4.0 is a simple, free distance learning
platform that runs in a web browser. It allows a facilitator to map
videos to keys on a computer keyboard and play them, like a video
piano, in any sequence, based on input from the learners.

 

## Structure 

Annenberg Hotkeys functions as a video player. 

A set of videos is
called a "**module**". 

Each module can consist of up to 26 videos, and
Hotkeys can load up to 10 modules at once, for a maximum of 260 video
files. Modules are organized as follows:

- `modules` Folder: 
   - Contains up to 10 numbered folders (`0`-`9`). 

- Subdirectories: 
   - Each numbered folder can have up to 26 subdirectories named with a single letter from `a`-`z`. 


Video Mapping: Any video placed in one of these subfolders will be mapped to the corresponding key when that module is active. 

With a maximum of two keystrokes (module, video), 260 different videos
of any length can be played instantly in any order the facilitator
desires.

 

## Loading Modules 

1. Default Location: 
   - The `modules` folder is in the Annenberg Hotkeys 4.0 folder by default, but it can be located anywhere (e.g., thumb drive, network drive). 

2. Adding Modules: 
   - Pre-existing Modules: 
     - Drag them into the modules folder.

   - Creating New Modules: 
     1. Create a folder numbered `0`-`9` in the modules folder. 
	 2. Inside this numbered folder, create between 1 and 26 subfolders lettered `a`-`z`.
